# Alojapp Frontend (Angular) - Login ready

This repository is a ready-to-install Angular frontend skeleton focused on the **Login** feature and Atomic Design structure.

## How to run (local)

1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. From project root run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run start
   ```
3. The app will open at `http://localhost:4200` (Angular CLI required).

## Notes
- The project includes Tailwind and Angular Material placeholders.
- AuthService points to `http://localhost:8080/api/auth` by default — modify in `src/environments/environment.ts`.
- Logo and assets are placeholders in `src/assets/`.
